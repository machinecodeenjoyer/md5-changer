# C++: Change MD5 Hash

## Overview
This C++ project demonstrates a simple modification to an executable file to change its MD5 hash while keeping it functional. The main purpose is to showcase how changing specific bytes in the code section of an executable can affect its hash value.

## How it works
The program reads the current executable file, locates the code section, and modifies a predefined pattern within the code. After modification, it writes the changes to a new file and calculates the MD5 hash for both the original and modified files.

## Repository Details

### Description
Explore the intricacies of modifying an executable file to change its MD5 hash while retaining functionality. This C++ project demonstrates the process of locating and altering specific bytes within the code section of an executable, providing insights into the impact on the resulting MD5 hash.

### Topics
- C++
- Windows API
- MD5 Hash
- Executable Modification
- Reverse Engineering
- Windows Programming
- Code Section Manipulation
- Educational

## Prerequisites
- Windows operating system
- Visual Studio or any C++ compiler that supports the Windows API

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/machinecodeenjoyer/modify-md5-hash.git
cd modify-md5-hash
```
2. Build the project using your preferred C++ compiler or IDE.

3. Run the executable. If successful, it will display the original and modified MD5 hashes.
